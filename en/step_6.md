- Why not have a look at the [Getting Started with the Twitter API](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-with-the-twitter-api/) resource, and have your Raspberry Pi tweet you when the CPU temperature gets too high?
- There are other ways of sensing temperature, and a host of other environmental variables. Have a look at [Getting started with the Sense HAT](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-with-the-sense-hat) for some more ideas.
