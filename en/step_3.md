## Writing the data to a CSV file

It would be useful if that data could be stored somewhere. A CSV (comma-separated values) file is ideal for this, as it can be used by applications like Excel and LibreOffice.

--- task ---
You'll want to log the date and time while getting the CPU temperatures, so you'll need some extra libraries for this. Add this to your imports:

```python
from time import sleep, strftime, time
```
--- /task ---

These extra methods let you pause your program (`sleep`), get today's date as a string (`strftime`), and get the exact time in what's known as [UNIX time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) (`time`).

--- task ---
To write to a file, you first need to create it. At the end of your program, add the following line:

```python
with open("/home/pi/cpu_temp.csv", "a") as log:
```
--- /task ---

This creates a new file called `cpu_temp.csv` and opens it with the name `log`. It also opens it in **append** mode, so that lines are only written to the end of the file.

--- task ---
Now, you'll need to start an infinite loop that will run until you kill the program with **Ctrl + C**:

```python
with open("/home/pi/cpu_temp.csv", "a") as log:
	while True:
```
--- /task ---

--- task ---
Inside the loop, you can get the temperature and store it as a variable.

```python
with open("/home/pi/cpu_temp.csv", "a") as log:
	while True:
		temp = cpu.temperature
```
--- /task ---

--- task ---
Now you want to write both the current date and time, plus the temperature, to the CSV file:

```python
with open("/home/pi/cpu_temp.csv", "a") as log:
	while True:
		temp = cpu.temperature
		log.write("{0},{1}\n".format(strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"),str(temp)))
```
--- /task ---

That line's a little complicated, so let's break it down a bit:

- `log.write()` will write whatever string is in the brackets to the CSV file.
- `"{0},{1}\n"` is a string containing two placeholders separated by a comma, and ending in a new line.
- `strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")` is inserted into the first placeholder. It's the current date and time as a string.
- `str(temp)` is the CPU temperature converted to a string, which is written into the second placeholder after the comma.

--- task ---
Lastly, you can add a single line to the end of your file to pause the script between writes. Here it's pausing for one second, but you can use any interval that you want:

```python
sleep(1)
```

The entire script should now look like this:

```python
from gpiozero import CPUTemperature
from time import sleep, strftime, time

cpu = CPUTemperature()

with open("/home/pi/cpu_temp.csv", "a") as log:
	while True:
		temp = cpu.temperature
		log.write("{0},{1}\n".format(strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"),str(temp)))
		sleep(1)
```
--- /task ---
