# Temperature Log

The BCM2835 system on a chip (SoC) of the Raspberry Pi has a temperature sensor that can be used to measure its temperature from the command line. It can provide information on how much heat the chip has generated during operation and also report on the temperature of the environment. This project's aim is to create a simple shell script that can run automatically as you boot up your Raspberry Pi, take measurements from the temperature sensor at given intervals, and write them into log files that can be viewed later.

## Requirements

### Hardware

For accurate timestamps in your logs, you can optionally use a [Real Time Clock](http://www.modmypi.com/raspberry-pi/breakout-boards/raspberry-pi-%28official%29/piface-shim-rtc-real-time-clock/) accessory

## Worksheet & included files

- [The worksheet](worksheet.md)
- (Optional) Final version of the shell script: [temp_monitor.sh](code/temperature_log.sh)
    - Download to your Pi with `wget http://goo.gl/vV2SF5 -O temperature_log.sh --no-check-certificate`
